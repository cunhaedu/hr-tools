# A little about our company-like structure

> **Note:** If you don't know what is a 9-box system  please go back to the [main README](../readme.md) and take a look before carry on here!

When we research about the main target of a 9-box system we find out the it's in general HR and managers. What those people have in common? Well, they work in companies and are always struggling to find an app that fits in their structure what is not always going to happen once those companies got their own structure witch can variety a lot depending on the company size, the management and other factors.</br>
But why am I telling you this?
In order to develop our 9-box system we need to considerate it and develop a system that can fit in any kind of structure. For that we are going to create a general structure that consider the company layout and its levels as the core, for example:

![company-structure-example](./assets/company-structure-example.png)

> Notice that here we got at least four levels, witch are:
> - level 1 (Business unit | Branch)
> - level 2 (Directory)
> - level 3 (Area)
> - level 4 (Sector)
